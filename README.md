# RTL2GDSII-PROJECT
In this project, i have designed the whole RTL to GDSII flow of an 8-bit ripple carry adder using 1 bit full adder. I have deigned the rtl code for both ripple adder and full adder and went all the way from floorplanning till routing stage. The slack achieved was 0.22 which was the targeted time (between 0 to 1).
